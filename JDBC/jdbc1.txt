JDBC
=======
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is also known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program execution execution is completed , we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation, we are making our applications writing the data into files or database softwares.

Files and Database softwares act like a permanent storage device or medium.


Persistence
--------------
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Import terminologies
====================

i)Persistence store 
-----------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Files 
	Database softwares

ii)Persistence data 
--------------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	records
	tables 	

iii)Persistence operations
-------------------------
Insert,Update,Delete,Create and Select are called persistence operations.
In the realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation or CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
ex:
	C - create	S - select
	U - update	C - create
	R - read	U - update
	D - delete	D - delete

iv)Persistence logic
---------------------
Persistence logic having the capability to perform persistence operations.
ex:
	JDBC Code
	Hibernate code
	ibatis code
	IOStream  

v)persistence technology 
------------------------
Persistence technology is used to develop persistence logics.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate
	Ibatis 


Q)What is JDBC ?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop peristence logics having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.



Note:
-----
				IOStream 
	JavaApp	------------------------------------- Files
		   Serialization / Deserialization	


				JDBC code
	JavaApp	------------------------------------- Database s/w's 

Serialization
----------------
The process of changing object state to file state is called serialization.
In serialization object will not store in a file , object data will store in a file.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
-----------------
The process of taking the data from file and representing an object is called deserialization.

Diagram: jdbc1.2


Limitations with files as a persistence store
============================================
> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> It does not show an application with relationship(1-1,1-m,m-1,m-m).

> It does not allow us to apply constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE , primary key,   foreign key and check.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and Comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages of database software as persistence store
==================================================

> It will store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> It shows an application with relationship.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily. 


Every JDBC application is a two-tier application where java with jdbc code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

Endusers are non-technical persons , they can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software so they depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver 
============
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java calls to database calls and database calls to java calls.

Here calls means instructions. 

Diagram: jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver
==========
DK2 , VBScript, Perl and etc uses ODBC driver to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC driver is developed in C language by taking the support of pointers. But java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation Sun micro system introduced JDBC driver exclusively.

We will get JDBC software from following parties.

1) Sun Micro System (creator of JDBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 
			
We will get ODBC software from following parties.

1) Xopen (creator of ODBC driver)

2) Database vendor 

3) Third party vendor 			

Q)How many drivers are there in JDBC?

We have four drivers in JDBC.

1)Type1 JDBC driver (JDBC-ODBC bridge driver / partly java driver)

2)Type2 JDBC driver (Native API / partly java driver)

3)Type3 JDBC driver (Net Protocol / java driver)

4)Type4 JDBC driver (Native Protocol / java driver)


To use any JDBC driver we need to register with DriverManager service.

Every JDBC application contains one built-in service called DriverManager service.


Class.forName()
----------------
It is used to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

This method is used to load the driver class but it won't create an object.

ex:
	Class.forName("driver-class-name");


Connection object
------------------
A Connection is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

To perform any operation on database we need to establish the connection.

Once work with database software is completed then we need to close the connection.


DriverManager.getConnection()
-------------------------------
DriverManager is a class which is present in java.sql package.

A getConnection() is a static method which returns one JDBC connection object represent connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("driver-url","uname","pwd");


Statement object
--------------------
A Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is used to sends and executes our SQL query in database software.

We can create Statement object by using createStatement() method of Connection object.
ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();
