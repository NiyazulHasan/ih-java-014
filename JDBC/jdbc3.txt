Type1 JDBC Driver Architecture / (JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver/ partly java driver)
===============================================================================
Type1 JDBC Driver is not designed to interact with database software directly.

It is designed to take the support of ODBC driver and Vendor DB library to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc3.1

Advantages:
---------
Type1 JDBC driver is used to interact with any database software.

It is a built-in driver of JDK.

Disadvantages
-------------
This driver performance is low.It is not suitable for medium and large scale projects.Hence it is not a industry standard driver.

To work with type1 jdbc driver we need to arrange odbc driver and vendor db library 
seperately.

Since ODBC driver and vendor db library present at client side so it is suitable for untrusted applets to database communicationn.


Type2 JDBC driver Architecture / (Native API / partly java driver)
=====================================================================
Type2 JDBC driver is not designed to interact with database software.

It is designed to take the support of vendor db library to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc3.2

Advantages:
------------
Type2 jdbc driver will give better performance when compare to Type1 jdbc driver.

Type2 jdbc driver will not take the support of ODBC driver.

Disadvantages:
---------------
This driver performance is bit slow.It is not suitable for medium and large scale projects.Hence it is not a industry standard driver.

To work with type2 jdbc driver we need to arrange vendor db library seperately.

Since vendor db library present at client side so it is not suitable for untrusted applets to database communication.

For every database software we need to arrange type2 jdbc driver.


Type4 JDBC driver Architecture / (Native Protocol / java driver)
===================================================================
Type4 JDBC driver is not designed to take the support of odbc driver and vendor db library.

It is designed to interact with database software directly.

Type4 JDBC driver is also known as thin driver.

Diagram: jdbc3.3

Advantages:
-----------
Type4 jdbc driver will give better performance when compare to type1 & type2 driver.
It is suitable for medium and large scale projects.Hence it is a industry standard driver.

This driver is completely developed in java .Hence it will give platform independency.

Since ODBC driver and vendor db library not required at client so it is suitable to perform untrusted to database communication.

To work with type4 jdbc driver we don't need to arrange odbc driver and vendor db library.

Diadvantages:
--------------
It is not a built-in driver of JDK.

For every database we need to arrange type4 jdbc driver seperately.


JDBC Connection pooling
=========================
It is a factory containing set of readily available JDBC connection objects before actual being used.

Diagram: jdbc3.4

JDBC connection pool represent connectivity with same database software.

Advantages:
-----------
It will create reusable JDBC Connection objects.

With minimum Connection objects we can interact with multiple clients.

A user is not responsible to create , manage and destroy JDBC Connection objects in JDBC Connection pool.  JDBC Connection pool is responsible to create ,manage  and destroy JDBC Connection object.




Type3 JDBC Driver Architecture (Net Protocol)
================================================
Webserver  or proxy server or IDE's server containing JDBC Connection pool represent JDBC Connection objects.

Type3 JDBC driver is not designed to interact with database software directly.

It is designed to interact with web server or proxy server to get one resuable JDBC Connection object from JDBC Connection pool.

Diagram: jdbc3.4

With respect to the diagram
----------------------------
1)First webserver or proxy server intract with database software to get some reusable jdbc
  Connection objects in JDBC Connection pool.

2)Our application interacts with web server or proxyserver to get one reusable jdbc 
  Connection object from jdbc Connection pool.

3)Our application uses reusable jdbc Connection object, to create other Connection objects.

4)Once if we close i.e con.close() then Connection object goes back to JDBC Connection pool. 


Q)Types of Connection objects?

We have two types of Connection objects.

1)Direct Connection object
-----------------------
A connection object which is created by the user is called direct direct connection object.
ex:
	Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:XE","system","admin");

2)Pooled JDBC Connection object
---------------------------------
A connection object which is gathered from JDBC Connection pool is called pooled jdbc connection object.
